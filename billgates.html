      <h2>Early Life</h2>
      <p>Bill Gates was born William Henry Gates III on <em>October 28, 1955</em>, in Seattle, Washington. </p>
      <p>Bill Gates grew up in an upper middle-class family with his older sister, Kristianne, and younger 
        sister, Libby. Their father, William H. Gates Sr., was a promising, if somewhat shy, law student when 
        he met his future wife, Mary Maxwell. She was an athletic, outgoing student at the University of 
        Washington, actively involved in student affairs and leadership. The Gates family atmosphere was warm
        and close, and all three children were encouraged to be competitive and strive for excellence. Bill 
        showed early signs of competitiveness when he coordinated family athletic games at their summer house on
        Puget Sound. He also relished in playing board games (Risk was his favorite) and excelled at Monopoly. 

        Bill had a very close relationship with his mother, Mary, who after a brief career as a teacher devoted 
        her time to helping raise the children and working on civic affairs and with charities. She also served
        on several corporate boards, including those of the First Interstate Bank in Seattle (founded by her 
        grandfather), the United Way and International Business Machines (IBM). She would often take Bill along 
        when she volunteered in schools and at community organizations.</p>
      <p>Bill was a voracious reader as a child, spending many hours poring over reference books such as the 
        encyclopedia. Around the age of 11 or 12, Bill's parents began to have concerns about his behavior. He 
        was doing well in school, but he seemed bored and withdrawn at times, and his parents worried he might
        become a loner. Though they were strong believers in public education, when Bill turned 13, they enrolled
        him at Seattle's exclusive preparatory Lakeside School. He blossomed in nearly all his subjects, excelling
        in math and science, but also doing very well in drama and English.</p>
